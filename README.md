Hello, It's Farshad :)


Here, I am trying to share my notes and experiences about Linux Device Driver programming. Maybe some other topics that I know about them (In future) too.

I tried to make some examples from scratch to complex codes here for you, please take a look and let me know if you need more help or help me by sharing your experience with me, then I can update my source code here. Thanks.


Let's start with Linux Device Driver.
